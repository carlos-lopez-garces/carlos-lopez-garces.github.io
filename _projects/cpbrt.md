**CPBRT** is my physically-based, offline toy renderer. It is the result of studying ***[Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation](https://pbr-book.org/)*** (Pharr, Jakob, and Humphreys, 2016), writing down the code fragments provided by the authors, and filling in the gaps. For the longest time, I wanted to have a playground to learn interesting rendering techniques and try out new ideas. Taking inspiration from great rendering engineers like Yining Karl Li and his [Takua Renderer](https://www.yiningkarlli.com/projects/takuarender.html), Edward Liu and his [EDXRay](http://behindthepixels.io/EDXRay/), and Peter Kutz and his [Photorealizer](https://peterkutz.com/), I started CPBRT in November 2020 and it took me nearly 9 months to produce a 1st render with it; it was a tough, but infinitely rewarding experience.

## Features

| **Light transport algorithms:** Kajiya path tracing (unidirectional, unbiased Monte Carlo estimation of the light transport equation). Direct-lighting (no indirect illumination) and path (full global illumination) integrators. | **Reflectance models and BRDFs:** Lambert diffuse model, Oren-Nayar diffuse model for rough surfaces, Fresnel perfectly specular model, and Fresnel glossy specular model (with Torrance-Sparrow microfacets with Beckmann-Spizzichino distribution). |
| **Textures:** Floating-point and spectrum constant-value textures. (I haven't paid much attention to texturing.) | **Materials:** Matte with either a perfect diffuse Lambertian BRDF or an Oren-Nayar BRDF for various degrees of roughness; plastic with diffuse and glossy specular BRDFs; and mirror with a perfectly-specular BRDF. |
| **Shapes:** Triangle meshes, single triangles, and spherical implicit surfaces. | **Accelerators:** BVH with 5 different primitive (or object) subdivision methods: linear BVH, hierarchical linear BVH, midpoint partitioning, equal counts partitioning, and surface area heuristic (SAH).|
| **Samplers:** Uniform or jittered stratified pixel sampling for 1D samples and Latin Hypercube sampling for 2D samples. Samplers rely on a Permuted Congruential Generator (PCG) pseudo-random number generator. | **Filters:** Box, triangle, Gaussian, Mitchell-Netravali, and Lanczos windowed-sinc filters. |
| **Lights:** Point and diffuse area light sources. An area light can take the form of any of the supported *shapes*. | **Cameras:** Thin lens perspective and orthographic projective cameras with configurable aperture and focal distance (for depth of field) and film aspect ratio. The perspective camera also has a configurable field of view. |
| **Participating media:** Homogeneous-density and grid-based variable-density media coming soon. | |
