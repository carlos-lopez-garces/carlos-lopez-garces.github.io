[*Mastering Graphics Programming with Vulkan*](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-graphics-programming-with-vulkan/9781803244792){:target="_blank"} by Castorina and Sassone is a fantastic book that covers many modern rendering techniques implemented in an open source rendering engine called [*Raptor*](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Graphics-Programming-with-Vulkan){:target="_blank"}.

Aside from learning these techniques, my objective is to make improvements and extensions to the Raptor engine.

Below, you'll find a series of summaries of and annotations for the contents of the book, and, hopefully, descriptions of improvements and extensions that I manage to make.

- TODO: Variable rate shading.
- TODO: Frame graphs.
- TODO: GPU-driven rendering.
- TODO: DDGI.
- TODO: Clustered deferred rendering.
