Hi there! I'm a rendering engineer interested in physically-based rendering, real-time graphics techniques, and light transport theory. I'm currently a **graduate student** of Computer Graphics at [**UPenn**](https://www.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"} ('23-'25). 

Previously, I earned a **BSc in Computer Science** from [Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en){:target="_blank"} in 2010 and a **BSc in Mathematics** from [Indiana University](https://www.iu.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} in 2023.

In the past, I worked in Silicon Valley for [**Oracle**](https://www.oracle.com/index.html){:target="_blank"} on the kernel of the Oracle database server, for [**Apcera**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apcera){:target="_blank"} (now a subsidiary of Ericsson) on a container runtime and orchestrator for the cloud, and at [**HOVER**](https://hover.to){:target="_blank"} doing real-time rendering and geometry processing.
