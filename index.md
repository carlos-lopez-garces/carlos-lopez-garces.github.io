Hi there! I'm a computer graphics software engineer interested in physically-based rendering and light transport theory. I earned a BSc in Computer Science from [Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en) in 2010 and I'm currently a student at [Indiana University](https://www.iu.edu/index.html) majoring in Mathematics. In the past, I worked for [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html) on the kernel of the Oracle database server and for [Apcera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apcera) (now a subsidiary of Ericsson) on a container runtime and orchestrator for the cloud.
