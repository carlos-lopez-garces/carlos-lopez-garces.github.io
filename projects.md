  My personal projects include a physically-based offline toy renderer (CPBRT), a real-time DirectX 12 toy renderer forked from Microsoft's MiniEngine (CDX), various HLSL and GLSL shaders featuring well-known rendering techniques, and a few interesting algorithm implementations from a past life as an OS and distributed systems engineer.
